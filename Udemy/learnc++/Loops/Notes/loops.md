## C++ Loops

Loops or repeated statements are iterative statements

**Loops Available**

1. While: Checks condition first
    ```c++
    while (<condition>)
    {
        process;
    }
    ```
2. Do While: does the process FIRST even if the process of the while is FALSE and then checks for the condition of the while
    ```c++
    do
    {
        process;
    } while (<condition>)
    ```


3. For Loops: Counting controlled loop, same as other languages:
    
    ```c++
        for(initilization; condition; increment)

        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            cout << i << endl;
        }
    ```
