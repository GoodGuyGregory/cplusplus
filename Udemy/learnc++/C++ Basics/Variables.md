**Variables**

These are used to represent values for numbers or data. such as the *rollno* example as an int it will take two values. 

prior to storing the value as a usable variable it is known as an initialized variable and before doing this it is known as a garbage variable.

initializing these variables can be seen below in the following example program

```c++
int main()
{
    // int value 
    int rollno = 10;
    // declares a char with the value 'A'
    char group = 'A';
// declare a float and add the f value
    float price = 12.75f;

// Variables in C++ are used with Words being capital
    int CplusplusValue = 56;

}
```
