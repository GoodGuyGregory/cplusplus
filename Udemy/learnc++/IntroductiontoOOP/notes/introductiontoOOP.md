## Introduction to OOPS:

**Modular Programming**

This is a procedure paradigm, everything was small scale applications that did specific tasks

Bank example:

Modular Programming approach will look at this program in a different way than OOP:

actions may include :

Functions: in this paradiam will just be sets of modules that will complete these tasks

* openAcc()
* deposit()
* withdraw()
* checkbal()
* applyload()

**Object Orientated Programming**

Government Example: The government supplies lots of public services... because of multiple components in the system scalling was needed and this paradigm took a dominant hold because of the complexities readily available for larger more common place machine computation tasks

These can be defined in this way.

Each of these objects will have its own relative functions that will operate in the Government system.

compared to the Bank example the Government is much easier becuase each object has its own modules and not one massive amount of code base.


### Main Principles of Object-Orientation

There are two main elements of Programming, and are needed to make software

* Data: objects items which are often numerical

* Functions: which manipulate that data



1. *Abstraction:* client side applications should focus on simple UI and other needs, like a car the user doesn't need to know how it works, they just need to turn a key and press the gas or brakes. The user doesn't need to know how things work. Dont need to see implementation of the Functions just the functions inside of a class, 

2. *Encapsulation:* this technique keeps items safe from miss, not for security, making data private and functions as Public.

3. *Inheritance:* from the car example in heritance is the way program's class methods can be passed onto sub classes and child classes

4. *Polymorphism*: Similar to the Car example. when you learn to drive you dont learn a how to drive a specific model vehicle you learn how the drive a car. there are little differences when you make a class it will have different sub classes and adaptations to the main behavior or the root class but still have the same functionality of that class. Just a reuse of a class.
