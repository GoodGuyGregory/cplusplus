## Breadth First Search

*BFS* or Breath first search means that you can travel from an starting vertex you desire and create an exploration of each vertex you visit. While exploring you can visit additional neighboring Verticies in any order to define a tree definition of the graph.

**Formal Definitions**

* Visiting- Starting points for searching. Held values into a queue.

* Exploring- visiting additional verticies that are attached to a vertex. Dequeued values after exloring.

Queue Structures are the technical language way of doing this exploration process from a programmign language.
