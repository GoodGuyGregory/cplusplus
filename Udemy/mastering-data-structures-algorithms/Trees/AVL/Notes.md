## AVL Trees

Balance Factor = Height of Left Subtree - height or Right subtree 

Calculated from every node. should be {-1,0,1}

Balance Factor should be 

`bf = |hl - hr| <= 1`    

If Balance Factor is GREATER than 1 it is imbalanced, And Balancing must be done.

**Calculate Balance Factors**

 Practice Elements from the Video and labs in order to practice balancing the trees

 Balancing Trees is done through rotations at the time of insertions

 **Rotating AVL Trees**

Technique for Balancing the Trees Throught Right Rotation or Left Rotation to Balance the Trees Image like a thread is being held onto the whole chain and you are pulling in in a certain direction.

Rotations are always done through *Three* Nodes

Types of Rotation

* LL Rotation
* RR Rotation

Double Rotations

* LR Imbalance Rotation
* RL Imbalance Rotation
